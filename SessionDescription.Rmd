RMarkdown and Git for Collaborative Actuarial Analysis
========

Collaboration between actuaries presents
certain hurdles, including
reproducibility of shared results,
updating documentation, and
file sharing and versioning. 
This session will discuss two open-source tools that help 
overcome these hurdles:
RMarkdown and git.

RMarkdown provides two great benefits to an actuary

1. Literate programming -- The documentation of the analysis becomes 
integrated with the analysis itself
2. Reproducibility -- The analysis may be reproduced by someone other than 
the original author

When actuaries use spreadsheets (e.g., Excel), 
the documentation is usually in a different environment 
(e.g., Word or PowerPoint). 
The actuary must constantly update several documents to ensure consistency 
between exhibits and the narrative which supports them. 
Text which clarifies the intent and operation of complex calculations 
is often difficult to find or absent.
This creates operating risk to the actuary and the Principal, 
as well as lost opportunity to both in meeting the emerging requirements of 
auditors, management, and regulatory regimes such as Solvency II.

Git, invented by Linus Torvalds to handle development of his more
famous software, Linux, has become the most widely used
version control system for software development.
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have made git more accessible to
less technical folks, 
and its Windows implementation is almost "magical."

The session will walk through examples in the context of a reserve analysis.
