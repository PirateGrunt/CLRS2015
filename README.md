RMarkdown is a tool which provides two great benefits to an actuary

1. Literate programming - The documentation of analysis becomes a part of the analysis itself.
2. Reproducibility - The analysis may be reproduced by someone other than the original author

Spreadsheets suffer from many shortcomings, among them the fact that the analysis is often described in an environment separate from where it takes place. The actuary must constantly update several documents to ensure consistency between exhibits and the narrative which discusses them. Further, text which clarifies the intent and operation of complex calculations is either difficult to find or absent. The attendant operating risk is obvious. In addition, there is a lost opportunity to meet the emerging requirements of regimes like Solvency II, which demand that analysis be fully documented.

This session will explore the benefits of using RMarkdown as part of an actuary's workflow. RMarkdown is a technology which has emerged in the R community to support reproducibility of complex analysis and packaging of results in a variey of formats such as HTML, PDF and MSWord. The session will walk through a complete example of a reserve analysis
